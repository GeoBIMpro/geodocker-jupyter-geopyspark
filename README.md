# Introduction #

This repository contains the configuration and build files necessary to produce the [`quay.io/geodocker/jupyter-geopyspark` Docker image](https://quay.io/repository/geodocker/jupyter-geopyspark?tab=tags).
The Docker image allows easy use of [GeoPySpark](https://github.com/locationtech-labs/geopyspark) in a web browser via [Jupyter](https://github.com/jupyter/jupyter/) and [GeoNotebook](https://github.com/opengeoscience/geonotebook) without having to modify or configure the host computer (beyond what is needed to run Docker).

The process of [using a pre-built container](#without-a-clone) is discussed in the next section,
and instructions for [building the image](#building-the-image) and [modifying it](#modifying-the-image-or-image-architecture) are also discussed.
